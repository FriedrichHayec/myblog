### Github page
Relative path is not supported !
You should add ```https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/```github in front of your path, and delete the ```.``` dot operator.
```USERNAME``` is your github username, ```REPOSITORY``` is the repository contains your webpage that you want to show!
for example:

WRONG:cry:
```HTML
<script src="./library/xxx.js"></script>
```

RIGHT:smile:
```HTML
<script src="https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/library/xxx.js"></script>
```

and don't forget to add a index.html in ```https://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY/```
